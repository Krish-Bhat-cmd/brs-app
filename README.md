CONTEXT: Recommender systems have become integral to various industries, driven by platforms like YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix. These algorithms suggest relevant items to users, such as products, movies, or articles, based on preferences. They are crucial for generating revenue and gaining a competitive edge. A notable example of their importance is Netflix's "Netflix Prize," where a $1 million reward was offered for improving its recommender system's performance.
After being inspired by such incredible use cases of recommendation systems, we decided to build a â€œBook Recommendation".
